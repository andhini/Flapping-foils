# Flapping-foils #
These are several python postprocessing codes/files for my PhD project in flapping foil. 
The CFD is created using computational package Lotus belong to my supervisor Dr Weymouth for Boundary Data Immersion Method with implicit-LES solver.
Some of the paraview processing require  '*.vti' and/or '*.vtr' files.

Please follow the following link for the supplementary files for our PNAS manuscript 'Fin sweep angle does not determine flapping propulsive performance'.
