## Flapping foil for animal locomotion

![Flipper image](https://andhini.github.io/Flapping-foils/flipper.png)

The sweep back angle in animal propulsion surfaces such as fishtails, mammal flukes, and aquatic flippers is shown to have a negligible influence on fluid dynamic force and power. As such, animal fins and flukes can occur over a wide range of sweep angles without a propulsion penalty, explaining the observed variation in nature.

The following link provide an interactive parallel-axis plot for the study results we did on the sweep angle & aspect ratio variation: [Parcoords](https://andhini.github.io/Flapping-foils/Parallel-Coordinate_SweepAngle/parallel_plotly.html).

The static graph is also provided in github [link](https://andhini.github.io/Flapping-foils/Parallel-Coordinate_SweepAngle/ParallelPlot_MatplotlibVersion.png), with the full python scripts are provided for both static and interactive ones in [my github](https://github.com/andhini/Flapping-foils/tree/master/Parallel-Coordinate_SweepAngle).
