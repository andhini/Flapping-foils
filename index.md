## Flapping foil for animal locomotion

![Flipper image](https://andhini.github.io/Flapping-foils/flipper.png)

The sweep back angle in animal propulsion surfaces such as fishtails, mammal flukes, and aquatic flippers is shown to have a negligible influence on fluid dynamic force and power. As such, animal fins and flukes can occur over a wide range of sweep angles without a propulsion penalty, explaining the observed variation in nature.

The following link provide an interactive parallel-axis plot for the study results we did on the sweep angle & aspect ratio variation: [Interactive Parcoords](https://andhini.github.io/Flapping-foils/Parallel-Coordinate_SweepAngle/parallel_plotly.html). Unfortunately, it the interactive graph is very heavy to be embeded in this page.

The static graph is also provided in github [link](https://andhini.github.io/Flapping-foils/Parallel-Coordinate_SweepAngle/ParallelPlot_MatplotlibVersion.png) along with the data in csv. The static graph looks like this :

The full python scripts are provided for both static and interactive ones in [my github](https://github.com/andhini/Flapping-foils/tree/master/Parallel-Coordinate_SweepAngle) along with the correlation coefficients heatmap graph.

Heatmap of Pearson correlation and the correlation ratio script provide easy explanation of correlation between inputs (motion, aspect ratio and sweep angle) and outputs (The coefficients of lift CL, thrust CT, power and efficiency). The following graph can be accesed through this [link](https://github.com/andhini/Flapping-foils/tree/master/Heatmap_correlation).
