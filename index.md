## Flapping foil for animal locomotion

The sweep back angle in animal propulsion surfaces such as fishtails, mammal flukes, and aquatic flippers is shown to have a negligible influence on fluid dynamic force and power. As such, animal fins and flukes can occur over a wide range of sweep angles without a propulsion penalty, explaining the observed variation in nature.

The following link provide an interactive parallel-axis plot for sweep angle & aspect ratio variation: [Parcoords](https://andhini.github.io/Flapping-foils/Parallel-Coordinate_SweepAngle/parallel_plotly.html). 

The static graph is also provided in github [link](https://andhini.github.io/Flapping-foils/Parallel-Coordinate_SweepAngle/ParallelPlot_MatplotlibVersion.png)
